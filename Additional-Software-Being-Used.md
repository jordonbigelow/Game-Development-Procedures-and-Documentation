# These are the other applications that will be used to make our games
1. Aseprite [steampage for Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org)
- This is a lovely piece of software that is just a joy to use.
- It's $20.00 on steam, but does have a free version
- It is used for all our Art needs (so far)

2. Notion [Notion Download](https://www.notion.so/download)
- This is a project management software, to aid in collaboration to make managing projects easy and to document everything along the way. Documentation is important!
- This app has a mobile version (handy for when you're on the go)
- This app also has a dektop version (this is the one I prefer most of the time)
- This app also has a web based version if you'd rather not install anything on your machine
- I use my google account to authenticate. You can use a few social accounts to create an account. I reccomend doing this for backup and collaboration purposes.

3. Logic Pro X [Logic Pro's Webpage](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/)
- This is one that I will primarily use as I have a Mac and that is required for this software. However, if anybody wants to help me write music in a collaborative manner, I will drive the software, while other people provide feedback.
- This is not required for anybody else to purchase. I just wanted to list it for documentation purposes, so we have a clear tech stack we are using to build our games.
