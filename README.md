# Purpose of this Repo
Hello All! This is simply a knowledgebase that I am building for my game development journey. I hope that it can aid others that may want to contribute get past the hurdle of just getting started and best practices.

It will also be a repo that develops over time, and will contain knowledge resources that will aid collaboration on small game projects.

The structure here should be obvious to navigate to the content you are looking for. 

If you have questions, please feel free to ask.
