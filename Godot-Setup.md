## How to install VSCode
I prefer to use VScode because of the power of the extension marketplace. It allows you to customize how you like to work best, and it's just a better overal editor and can benefit you in a professional setting if you learn it here in a casual setting.

For example, one of my favorite extensions is the VIM extension. This brings VIM motion functionality into the editor which lets me have a more keyboard centric workflow which keeps me productive. I don't really like using the mouse while I do software development.

[Name: Vim Id: vscodevim.vim Description: Vim emulation for Visual Studio Code Version: 1.28.1 Publisher: vscodevim VS Marketplace Link:](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)
- This should get you right to one that I prefer to use.
- I like VIM motions because it **gamifies** my dev work flow. It's like figuring out the controls to a videogame, and for my nuerodivergent ass. It scratches an itch my brain has. I LOVE to use keyboards. Vim allows me to edit code completely with my fingers on the home row, instead of using the mouse for navigation. This speeds up development time (for me).

## How to get VSCode working as Godot's editor; instead of using the built in one (optional)

- Make sure you don't forget to download the godot-tools extension using the built-in extensions marketplace in VSCode.

## Now What?
Ok, you downloaded a game engine and you're ready to get started?! I'd recommend taking a short tutorial into how GDScript works
- This is the language the the game engine uses. It's a lot like Python and very easy to read and learn. Very recommended for beginners to development.
This is also a very useful link that will be your go to resource for learning Godot [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.3/index.html)

You can follow this tutorial to understand the basics of GDScript [very fun tutorial](https://www.gdquest.com/learn-to-code-from-zero/)
- It's very gamified so it doesn't take too long to get through. It's also built with Godot! Fun little fact.

You can download my tutorial project that I build and interact with the engine and look at all the bits here on my repo on github!

- All you need to do is download this folder, and then use the import project option in Godot and boom, you have your first working Game that you can interact with all yourself!
- If you're curious to follow this tutorial yourself, I followed a very short youtube tutorial to build this little platformer. All the assetts are included within the description of the youtube video.

The individual in this video is very well respected in the Game Dev community. He is well known for providing high quality tutorials for the Unity Engine. But he recently switched to Godot! As he should, Godot is awesome!
